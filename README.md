# My Lightstrip

### Background

Originally, I started this project to learn how to create an Alexa skill. I also used this opportunity to create an iOS companion app.

Taking inspiration from the Philips Hue product line, the Alexa skill and iOS app enables the user to change the colour and brightness of a WS2812 light strip.



### About

I made this app to mimic some of the features in the Philips Hue app. Users can pick the hue, saturation, and value of the light strip. The app has pre-installed scenes and users are able to create new ones. 
The app also allows for more granular colour/brightness adjustments compared to the Alexa skill.
